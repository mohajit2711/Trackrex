# Trackrex
To build a software that maps  a human face and  based on tracking, detects the emotions and identifies the person's mood.
To demonstrate the real-life applications of Blue Eyes technology through facial tracking and mood-recognition based software.
To create suggestions for tasks and activities based off the user's currrent mood and help them have a productive day.

This system works well because it can

Map your face and apply location co-ordinates to it, to be able to track your facial movements
Compare this input to the existing database of co-ordinates, and detects your mood based on that
Recommend you suggestions based on what you wish to do - listen to music, watch movies - and takes you directly to the associated platforms

Where it can be used:

Personal use, for when the user wants to just use the recommendations system
Worplaces, so that employees can use their breaks efficiently so as to continue with their day productively
